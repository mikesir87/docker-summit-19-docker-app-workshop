## Exercise Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you will have:

- Learned about Docker Compose
- Explored the Voting App application stack

During this exercise we will build a Docker Compose file that is ready to deploy as a Docker Application.

## Docker Compose Background

Docker Compose is a tool designed to make it easy to define and share multi-container applications. While you can do everything in Docker Compose with Docker CLI commands, defining it in a YAML file makes it easy to share and review. Plus, the application stack is able to be version controlled.

For this exercise, we will start with an existing compose file. But, it has missing pieces in it, which we will fill in to learn about the various components of a compose file. We will then build on this file for the next exercises. Note that, when creating your own file in the future, only compose version 3 schema is supported in Docker App.

Many development teams have a `docker-compose.yml` file that is intended for development (mounts in source code, uses a dev-enabled container) and a `docker-stack.yml` file for production deploys (uses built images, no code mounting). Since Docker App requires a production deploy, it'll typically reflect the setup used in a `docker-stack.yml` file. For simplicity in this exercise (since we are using Docker Compose), we are using a `docker-compose.yml`.


## The Application

For this workshop, we will use a modified version of the [Voting App](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app). This application contains the following services:

- A Python webapp that provides the ability to vote between two options
- A Redis cache to store new votes
- A .NET Core worker to consume votes and store them inâ€¦
- A Postgres DB backed by a Docker volume for storing results
- A Node.js webapp to show the results of the voting in real time

## Finishing the Compose File

The [compose file found in the `exercise1` directory](./docker-compose.yml) has all of the services needed for the application, but has a few missing pieces to help us learn a little bit more about Docker Compose. We will fill in a few pieces now, but will continue to evolve our compose file as we advance through the workshop.


### Helpful Tips for Play-with-Docker

- Working within the terminal can be tricky, especially for folks not familiar with CLI-based text editors. To help, use the "Editor" feature in PWD.

- You can drag-and-drop files from your local machine on to the terminal to easily upload them.

- If you'd rather, you can SSH into your instance using the SSH command above the web-based terminal.


### Exposing the Vote and Result Apps

Both the `vote` and `results` services are webapps. However, there's currently no port mapping for the services. In order to access the apps, we need to expose the ports.

1. The `vote` service exposes its application on port 80. For this service, use the "[short syntax](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#short-syntax-1)" to map port 80 to port 5000 on the host. 

    <details>
      <summary>Solution</summary>

    ```yml
    services:
      vote:
        ports:
          - 5000:80
    ```
    </details>


2. The `results` service also exposes its application on port 80. Since we can't use the same port, let's expose this service on port 5001. For practice, expose its port using the "[long syntax](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#long-syntax-1)". While longer, it's much easier to quickly see what's going on and helps those that can't remember the order of ports in the short syntax.

    <details>
      <summary>Solution</summary>

    ```yml
    services:
      results:
        ports:
          - target: 80
            published: 5001
            protocol: tcp
            mode: host
    ```
    </details>




### Persisting our Database's Data

Databases are pretty important and it's usually preferred to keep the data longer than a single container restart. As such, we need to store the data in a volume. 

In this case, we don't care _where_ the data is stored, as long as it's there every time we start the container. This is a good candidate for using a named volume. 

1. We first need to declare a new volume in the `volumes` section. Let's just name it `db-data` and let it use the default `local` driver.

    <details>
      <summary>Solution</summary>

    ```yaml
    volumes:
      db-data:
    ```
    </details>

2. Add a volume mapping for our new volume (`db-data`) that mounts to the container's `/var/lib/postgresql/data` directory. Practice using the "[short syntax](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#short-syntax-3)" format.

    <details>
      <summary>Solution</summary>

    ```yaml
    services:
      db:
        volumes:
          - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ```
    </details>


**NOTE:** Since we are using a local volume, we do have a chance of data loss. If running this app in a clustered environment and a container restart is scheduled on another node, a new local volume will be created on the new node. Therefore, **we should use a network-enabled volume driver in a production environment**. For this workshop, we will just use the local driver.


## Starting the Application Stack

Now that we have our compose file setup and configured, let's start it up! 

1. Use the `docker-compose up -d` command to start up the application stack in the background (allowing us to still use the terminal).

    ```bash
    $ docker-compose up -d
    Creating network "front-tier" with the default driver
    Creating network "back-tier" with the default driver
    Creating volume "root_db-data" with default driver
    Creating root_redis_1  ... done
    Creating root_worker_1 ... done
    Creating root_db_1     ... done
    Creating root_result_1 ... done
    Creating root_vote_1   ... done
    ```

    You'll see all of the networks, volume, and services get created. 
    
2. After a moment, you should see badges appear for the exposed ports. Click on the badge for 5000 to visit the vote app and 5001 for the results app.

### Other Useful Commands

- `docker-compose logs -f` - view all of the logs for all services in the application stack.
- `docker-compose ps` - view all containers running in the application stack. Similar to `docker ps`, but just for the stack

```bash
$ docker-compose ps
    Name                   Command               State          Ports
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
root_db_1       docker-entrypoint.sh postgres    Up      5432/tcp
root_redis_1    docker-entrypoint.sh redis ...   Up      6379/tcp
root_result_1   node server.js                   Up      0.0.0.0:5001->80/tcp
root_vote_1     gunicorn app:app -b 0.0.0. ...   Up      0.0.0.0:5000->80/tcp
root_worker_1   /bin/sh -c dotnet src/Work ...   Up
```

## Cleaning Up

1. Once you're done, go ahead and shut everything down by running `docker-compose down`.

    ```bash
    $ docker-compose down
    Stopping root_vote_1   ... done
    Stopping root_result_1 ... done
    Stopping root_redis_1  ... done
    Stopping root_db_1     ... done
    Stopping root_worker_1 ... done
    Removing root_vote_1   ... done
    Removing root_result_1 ... done
    Removing root_redis_1  ... done
    Removing root_db_1     ... done
    Removing root_worker_1 ... done
    Removing network front-tier
    Removing network back-tier
    ```

2. You'll see that all of the containers and networks are removed. However, volumes are NOT removed by default. If you wish to remove the volume, add the `-v` flag.

    ```bash
    $ docker-compose down -v
    Removing volume root_db-data
    ```

And now we're ready for the [next exercise](../exercise2)!
